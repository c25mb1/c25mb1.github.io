<div class="journaltext1">Hii! Its time for my first journal entry and this week I begin the foundations of my website! Thats what your reading this on right now! I used a lot of css to define the color and other properties such as a border. One thing that was challenging for me was positoning. I used a combonation of left and top commands which move the stuff around to place things where I wanted it! Another intresting thing that I learned was about vw which means the text changes sizes based on the screen page! Anyways see you next week!</div>

<div class="journaltext2">Hii! This week was my second week working on my website. I have started drawing what I want my home page to look like but it is taking a while so i haven't implemented it yet. Another thing I have been geting used to is pshing my website onto github. I have to open repositories and type a series of commands to make my website life. We also started one of our first projects which is a suprise present. I made mine extra complicated so stay tuned on how I acomplished that! </div>

<div class="journaltext3">Hii! This week I took a break from working on my website but still need to finish drawing it. I worked on the present which was fun but also very frustrating. It has two pages and one thing I still need to learn is how to make a gif repeat infinitly. I spent a lot of time on positoning which is hard in css. This week I also learned how to implemtent java script into my code to make it more interactive and you do this my the script function. See you next week! </div>

<div class="journaltext4">Hii! This week I tried implementing the javascript that I learned last week nto a project where I make ballons move up and down. I used variables which are like containers that store information so you can use it at any times. I also used funtions which are like a series of commands for the computer to do once you run the function and can change variables and all that jazz. In javascript I have learned a lot of words like function  and let but also ones like document addEventListener and much more. I used a funtion in my codeskecth to add a ballon image to the screen. See you next week! </div>

<div class="journaltext5">Hii! This week I finished up with my ballon project that I started last week! It was very confusing at first with all my "if" statments, which are thike saying if something is true then do this, but eventually I got through it (by putting the if statments in the function itself). Its the musical this week so I have had little time to start any new projects but I am looking foward to finnaly finishing the drawing of my website though in the time it took I kinds already want to change it so I will see how it goes! See you next week! </div>

<div class="journaltext6">Hii! This week I started a new project which is making hangman. It is very hard and I am nowhere near done but I'll share some of the things of have learned. First of all I learned about arrays which are like a list with infinte amounts of strings. I also had to incorprate random dunctions which can make a random number which allows me to pick a random word from my array. This is a big project but without the play I hopefully have more time to worl on it. See you next week!  </div>

<div class="journaltext7">Hii! This week I actually am wrapping up hangman project but it still needs some styling work. I learned a lot about if statments once again and various functions. I have a lot of polishing to do but it is looking promising! I started a new project for my holiday gift which uses my new knowledge about if statments and random functions. I can definitly feel that I am starting to get more fluent with the language but still constantly googling things. See you next week!  </div>

<div class="journaltext8">Hii! This week we have returned from winter break. Right before winter break I wrapped up my hangman project and we started out this year with a data representation project. I have decided to go make people take my survey to collect my own data and have just started coding the fundamentals without the actual data. I like my current progress and becuase data representation is largely about visuals I have taken the time to pick good photoes and edit them to my liking. In terms of what I have learnedd coding-wise I have learned more about image fitting and styling. See you next week! </div>

<div class="journaltext9">Hii! This week I have worked hard on my quiz projects that I mentioned last week. It is definitly coming along but it is a big project so I wont share much more. On the side I also finished my curing covid project that I started months ago but didn't have the skills to complete. One major thing I learned about was inputs in html. They allow the user to input values to make but how I used them was I connected them to javascript for the game to be continusly changing them. I also used inputs to make a reset button! This was my first game hopefully of many so I will see you nect week!  </div>
